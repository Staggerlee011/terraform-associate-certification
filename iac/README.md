## Describe advantages of IaC patterns

versioning - allows for infrastrcutre to be stored in source control

repeatable - when creating a dev / uat / staging / production collection of environments there is a high likelyness of making a configuration different when done manually. Doing them via code allows you ensure they are the same.

testable - you can test your code for code smells, or anti pattenrs with linters. As well as testing code via tools like inspec / cloud custodian.
